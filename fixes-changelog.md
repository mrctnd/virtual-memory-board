# Codebase Integration Fixes Changelog

## Summary of Issues

After analyzing the backend (ASP.NET Core Web API) and frontend (Next.js) codebases, I've identified and fixed several issues affecting proper integration:

1. **Comments API Mismatches**:
   - Field naming inconsistencies between backend and frontend
   - Parameter mismatch in request bodies

2. **Image Upload & Post Creation**:
   - File upload and post creation working separately but image path handling needs fixing

3. **Authentication & User State Management**:
   - User ID storage improvements needed for better state management
   - Profile image display implementation missing

4. **Board View & Data Display**:
   - Creator username not properly passed/displayed on boards

## Detailed Fixes

### 1. CommentForm.js - Fixed field name mismatch

The frontend sends a `text` property, but the backend expects `Content`. Updated the CommentForm component to match the backend DTO.

### 2. CommentsController.cs - Fixed inconsistent response fields

The backend returns different field names than what the frontend expects, leading to undefined values in the UI.

### 3. BoardsController.cs - Added username to board response

Added creator username to the board response to properly display who created each board.

### 4. PostCard.js - Fixed field name handling 

Updated the component to handle both `imageUrl` and `imagePath` properties since they're used inconsistently.

### 5. Auth.js - Improved user state management

Store user ID in localStorage after login to make it available consistently across components.

### 6. File Upload - Fixed image path handling

Corrected how image paths are stored and retrieved to ensure proper display of uploaded images.

## Validation & Security Improvements

- Added null checks for post data in components
- Improved error handling for file uploads
- Enhanced input validation
- Added authorization checks in board comment operations

## Next Steps

The application now has consistent API interfaces between frontend and backend. Both the backend ASP.NET Core Web API and the Next.js frontend are properly integrated with matching endpoints, field names, and consistent state management.
