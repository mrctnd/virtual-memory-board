# Integration Analysis and Fixes for ASP.NET Core API and Next.js Frontend

## Summary of Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Comment API Inconsistencies
- **Issue**: The frontend `CommentForm.js` was sending a `text` property but the backend expected `Content` 
- **Fix**: Updated frontend to send `content` field to align with backend `CommentCreateDto`
- **Issue**: Field naming discrepancies between backend `CommentResponseDto` and frontend expectations
- **Fix**: Added backward compatibility fields (`Text`, `CreatedBy`) to the DTO for seamless frontend integration

### 2. File Upload and Post Creation
- **Issue**: The frontend expected `path` property in file upload response, but backend returned `filePath`
- **Fix**: Added `path` property in the `FileController` response for frontend compatibility
- **Issue**: Null reference issues with `allowedExtensions` in `FileController`
- **Fix**: Added null checks and fallback values for file extensions

### 3. Authentication and User Management
- **Issue**: Inconsistent user ID access across components
- **Fix**: Implemented localStorage storage of userId after login for better cross-component access
- **Fix**: Updated logout function to clean up both JWT token and user ID data

### 4. Image Display in Posts
- **Issue**: PostCard component was only checking for `imagePath` property
- **Fix**: Updated to handle both `imagePath` and `imageUrl` properties for consistent image display

### 5. Comment Display and Creation
- **Issue**: Board details page was missing proper field mapping for comment creator display
- **Fix**: Updated to check for both `createdBy` and `userName` properties

## Implementation Details

### 1. Backend (ASP.NET Core API)
- Updated `CommentsController.cs` to match frontend expectations
- Enhanced `CommentResponseDto` with compatibility fields
- Improved null handling in `FileController.cs`
- Added dual field naming in responses for backward compatibility

### 2. Frontend (Next.js)
- Fixed `CommentForm.js` to send correct field names
- Updated auth.js to store userId in localStorage after login
- Enhanced component field checking for better error handling
- Fixed image path handling in post displays

## Next Steps
The core integration issues have been resolved, but a full end-to-end testing should be performed to ensure all flows (login, board creation, post uploads, and comments) work correctly with the updated implementations.
